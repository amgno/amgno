# Hi there 👋

I'm **Magno**, a developer with a background in Communication Design from Politecnico di Milano. I've been interested in tech since I was young.


I work with **AI integration and prompt engineering**, using models like Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok. I focus on writing clean, modular code and understanding how to effectively use LLMs in practical applications.

I work across the stack and experiment with AI capabilities to build useful tools.
