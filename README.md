# Hi there 👋

I'm Alessandro Magnocavallo, a developer with a background in Communication Design from Politecnico di Milano. I've been interested in technology since I was young, and I focus on bridging design thinking with technical implementation.

## What I Do

I specialize in AI integration and prompt engineering, working with models like Claude, GPT, Gemini, and Grok. My approach centers on writing clean, modular code and understanding how to effectively leverage LLMs in practical applications.

I work mainly with **JavaScript**, **Python**, **HTML**, and **CSS**, building tools that solve real problems and exploring the capabilities of AI to create useful solutions.
